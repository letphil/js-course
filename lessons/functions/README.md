## functions

```
functions in javascript are blocks of code that can be reused throughout a program. they are defined using the function keyword followed by a name and a set of parentheses. the code block is then enclosed in curly braces.

functions can take parameters which are variables that are passed to the function when it is called. these parameters can be used within the function to perform some action.

functions can also return a value using the return keyword. this value can be used by the calling code to perform some action.



```

### syntax:

```
function functionName () {
    // code block
}
```

### example:

```
/**
    @name {string} - name of person
*/
function greet(name) {
    console.log('hello ' + name)
}

greet();
```
