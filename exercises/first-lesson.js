/**
 * Firstly, let’s get this out of the way,
 * FizzBuzz is a task where the programmer is
 * asked to print numbers from 1 to 100,
 * but here’s the catch, multiple of three should print “Fizz”
 * and similarly print “Buzz” for multiples of 5 and lastly
 * print “FizzBuzz” for multiples of three and five.
 */

// SOLUTION:
// code here

/**
 * iterate over array and create object with
 * string as key and count as value
 * log object
 * example ->
 * const arr = ['hello', 'world', 'hello'];
 * { 'hello': 2, 'world': 1 }
 *
 *
 *
 * const arr = ['javascript', 'java', 'java', 'python', 'javascript'];
 */

// SOLUTION:

/**
 * create multiplication table of 5
 * log the table
 *
 * should return ->
 * [
 *  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
 *  [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
 *  [3, 6, 9, 12, 15],
 *  [4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
 *  [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
 * ]
